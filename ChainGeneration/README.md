# Running the model to generate MCMC chain objects

This folder contains scripts to generate MCMC objects that will be used by further downstream analyses. 

*Downsampling* and *Datasets* are shell scripts that initialize batch jobs to run multiple jobs in parallel.

The main folder contains scripts to test the functionality of the model.
[DifferentialTesting](../master/ChainGeneration/DifferentialTesting) contains scripts to run the model on datasets for which biological analyses were done.

A brief description of its functionality can be found in th header of each script.
